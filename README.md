# Shortest_Path_Using_DSA

## Travel and Shopping Optimization

This project optimizes travel routes and shopping choices using Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path, Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree, and the knapsack algorithm for shopping optimization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Any supporting packages or dependencies (if applicable)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LakshithaR/Shortest_Path_Using_DSA.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Install any required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install python
    ```

### Running the Project

1. **Run the main script:**

    ```bash
    python Final_Python.py
    ```

2. **Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary details such as the starting point, destination, expected time, maximum weight, available items, weights, and discounts.**

3. **View the optimized travel itinerary, minimum spanning tree, and the selected items for shopping.**

## Algorithms Used

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two points in the travel itinerary.

### Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm is employed to find the minimum spanning tree, which helps optimize the travel route.

### Knapsack Algorithm

The knapsack algorithm is used for shopping optimization, selecting the items with the maximum discount within the weight limit.
